# Tree Compiler

## what?

The tree compiler is suposed to be a compiler for my own language.
i'm using python since i am folowing a tutorial,
but i do plan to do the compiler again in c++ or even this language,

## why?

i was bored

## how?

## issues

ignores public and private variables, might be that multiple "get" of the same lib cause errors,floats might not work, can only print out a string, can not  convert numbers to string

## then what works?

does compile to some basic c++ code
