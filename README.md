# Tree Compiler

## what?

The tree compiler is suposed to be a compiler for my own language.
i'm using python since i am folowing a tutorial,
but i do plan to do the compiler again in c++ or even this language,

## why?

i was bored

## how?

## issues

the code generation isn't made yet
and the compiler dosn't compile yet

## then what works?

the lexer and the parser do work now!
